				"title": "Georgia governor postpones Los Angeles trip as film industry protests new abortion law",
				"source": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/georgia-brian-kemp-los-angeles-abortion/index.html",
				"text": "Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has postponed a planned trip to Los Angeles as many big names in Hollywood have responded with outrage over recently passed anti-abortion legislation, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Tuesday.\nThe AJC said Kemp would no longer attend an event slated for next week and noted the timing of the delay came in the wake of Kemp signing into law a controversial bill that would generally ban abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected. Fetal heartbeat detection can come as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy -- when many women don't yet know they are pregnant.\nCody Hall, Kemp's spokesman, told CNN that they had \"confirmed a date to go out to LA this fall.\"\n\"In the meantime, the Governor will be touring production studios in GA to meet with employees and reaffirm his commitment to the film industry in our state,\" Hall said.\nIn recent years, following the passage of a tax incentive, Georgia has been the site of increasing film and television production, with the entertainment industry becoming a high-profile and widely-championed sector of the state's economy. But the recent passage of one of the strictest anti-abortion bills in the country has been met with condemnation by filmmakers, some of whom have said they will avoid production in the state because of the measure.\nOthers, including directors J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele, said they would continue to shoot in the state but donate their fees to the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and a Georgia election reform group.\nKemp signed the legislation earlier this month. Legal groups, including the ACLU, have pledged to challenge the law and called it an illegal infringement on established rights to abortion access.\nGeorgia GOP Sen. David Perdue said on Monday he doesn't think the backlash from Hollywood would hurt his state's economy."

				"title": "Donald Trump Jr. reaches deal with Senate Intelligence Committee for testimony in June",
				"source": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/donald-trump-jr-agree-to-senate-intel/index.html",
				"text": "Donald Trump, Jr. and the Senate Intelligence Committee have reached a deal for the President's eldest son to appear before the committee behind closed doors in mid-June, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\nThe agreement for Trump Jr.'s testimony comes after the committee issued a subpoena last month that sparked an intense blowback against Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina from Trump Jr.'s allies and many of Burr's Republican colleagues.\nThe interview will be limited to two-to-four hours and limited in scope to five-to-six topics, according to the sources. But questions about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the Trump Tower Moscow project will not be off limits, said two sources familiar with the matter.\nQuestions on Trump Tower Moscow and the Trump Tower meeting would be constrained to limited followups, a source close to Trump Jr. said, and if any of the same questions are asked from Trump Jr.'s initial 2017 interview, he will refer the committee to his prior testimony.\nBut a source close the committee said that Trump Jr. would be required to answer questions about discrepancies between his past testimony and what other witnesses have told both the Senate committee and special counsel Robert Mueller's team.\nThe two sides agreed it would be the last time Trump Jr. will be asked to come before the committee in relation to its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, the sources said.\nBefore the agreement was reached, the two sides were locked in a stand-off over the subpoena to Trump Jr. that nearly forced the North Carolina Republican to have to decide whether to hold the President's son in contempt. Trump Jr. faced a Monday deadline to respond to the committee's subpoena, but the committee agreed to extend the deadline an additional day as committee aides and Trump Jr.'s lawyers worked to negotiate an agreement, sources said.\nTrump Jr.'s legal team had crafted a letter they were ready to send to the committee ahead of the subpoena deadline stating that the President's son was prepared to be held in contempt, according to one source. The bottom line, the source said, was that Trump Jr. was not coming and was not going to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights."
