## Milestone1

### 1. Team Name:
GoDuck

### 2. Team Members:
Junyu Lai, Dingmei Gu, Ruoyi Yu

### 3. Proposal Describe App's Idea

##### a) Describe target user, why fit in theme, and why team members are not part of the target user

In our project, the target users are ESL(English as Second Language) students in community college, which fits the project theme this quarter because of all of us in the group neither ESL student nor community college students. The reasons why we are not in the target user population are none of us are studying in a community college and we are fluent in English.

##### b) What possible sources of real word data or APIs can use

The API we will use is Google News API and Google Translate API. Google News API will be used to collect data such as news as our dataset in the database for the application. Then, we will use Google Translate API to translate the news data and display to the user. We will also use an ESL words dataset to highlight ESL words in readings.

##### c) Ideas if want feedback from TAs.

The idea of this web application is to help ESL students learn English in their daily life. We use the API to get everyday news and translate the news in user's preferred language. After translation, the web application will show up both the original news text in English and the translated text in the same screen. By providing original and translated news to the users, they can learn English by understanding the meaning of the words or sentences in their mother language, and learning what is happening in the US so they can talk about the news with other native speakers. Furthermore, the web application will highlight the ESL words in our server list for the users, and user can favorite news, save vocabulary in their notebook, and viewing the history of news read.

##### d) Storyboards and paper prototypes

###### Storyboard 1:

This storyboard shows a scenario where Jack, an ESL student who feels this class is very hard to learn, wants to find a right way to study ESL. A friend suggests him to use a web app called DuoNews. He starting using DuoNews to learn ESL vocabularies and making a good progress, and got an A for his ESL class.

###### Storyboard 2:

This storyboard shows a scenario where Thomas, an ESL student who thinks remembering ESL vocabularies from handouts is too boring. He saw an ads for a web app called DuoNews and he wanted to try it. He feels very interesting to learn ESL with DuoNews now.

###### Prototype 2:

This prototype has a hidden sidebar menu compare to the prototype 1, and it has a more simple homepage. The news reading page is divided into two section: left is orginal text and right is translated text, which is easy for user
to compare two different languages and learn.
