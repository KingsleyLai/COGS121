## Milestone2

### 1. Project Idea:
Our project idea is to help ESL students learn English through our web application which allows users to get everyday news and translate them into their native languages. Based on the feedback from our TA, we made several improvements without changing the main idea: We modified our target user group as all ESL students without specifically targeting those in community colleges. We also improved the way we incorporate and present ESL words to help the user better learn them. Further, we now let users select the category/domain of news that they are interested in during the sign-up process.

### 2. screenshots:
Parts different from paper prototypes: 
- After the sign-up page, we added an "onboard" page which asks the user to select their native language and favorite category of news. 
- Removed the "Read News" button on the sidebar as news will be accessed from the home page.
- Removed the search bar from the navbar on all pages and added search bar on the "favorite", "history", and "notebook" page.
- Removed the "study sets" preview on home page. 
- ESL words highlighted in the "read news" page.

Other parts are similar to what we had in our paper prototypes.
